# TheStairs_game
The game is still in progress but I decided that I'll be posting my progres along the way, so yeah. Nothing crazy.

Also important note the whole thing is done in 2020.3.49f1 unity editor version cuz I despise the newer versions <3

IMPORTANT NOTE (09/12/2025): This project for now is abanodned because of lack of my brain power to come up with ANY puzzle ideas
mostly caused by the fact that rn I have work and collage to deal with. This does not mean that I won't be coming back to 
this project nor does it mean that I'm not gonna be working on any other projects. Right now I'm coming up with some other project that
is gonna be more simple minded (basically a parkour game). Probably as soon as I'll have some ideas of puzzles that would fit into
"The Stairs" I'm gonna write them down and when I'll get enough of them I will be coming back to working on The Stairs.
